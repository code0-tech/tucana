# Tucana

This repository is responsible for all gRPC definitions that we use.

## Setup

See the setup guide for the following languages. Support for other languages is not planed!

### Rust

See: [Crate](https://crates.io/crates/tucana)

```toml
[dependencies]
tucana = { version = "<version>" }
```

To enable additional features::

```toml
[dependencies]
tucana = { version = "<version>", features = ["sagittarius", "aquila"] }
```

### Ruby

See: [Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/tucana)

```ruby
gem 'tucana', '<version>'
```

Don't forget to initialize the required feature:
```ruby
# For Sagittarius
Tucana.load_protocol(:sagittarius)

# For Aquila
Tucana.load_protocol(:aquila)
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized with services functioning as servers. Each protocol in the Sagittarius folder corresponds to
services that Sagittarius must implement as a server.
